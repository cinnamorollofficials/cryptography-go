## Symetric Cryptography

### Defenition
Symetric cryptography is a type of encryption where the smake used for both encryption. That means the sender and receiver must shared a single secret key that they both keep private.

### How it works
1. The sender uses a secret ket to encrypt the plaintext message into ciphertext.
2. The ciphertext is sent over the network.
3. The receiver use the same secret key to decrypt the cuphertext back into teh original plaintext.

### Common Symetric Algorithm
1. DES(Data Encryptioin Standart)
2. 3DES(Triple DES)
3. AES(Advanced Encryption Standard)
4. Blowfish
5. Twofish
6. RC4, RC5, RC6
6. CAST

#### DES (Data Encryptioin Standart)
