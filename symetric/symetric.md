## Symetric Cryptography

### Defenition
Symmetric cryptography is a type of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
That means the sender and the receiver must share a single secret key that they both keep private.

### How it works
1. The sender uses a secret ket to encrypt the plaintext message into ciphertext.
2. The ciphertext is sent over the network.
3. The receiver use the same secret key to decrypt the cuphertext back into teh original plaintext.


### Common Asymetric mode


### Common Symetric Algorithm
1. DES(Data Encryptioin Standart)
2. 3DES(Triple DES)
3. AES(Advanced Encryption Standard)
4. Blowfish
5. Twofish
6. RC4, RC5, RC6
6. CAST
